## ðŸ§  Project Overview

This project is part of our final undergraduate project in Electrical Engineering at Tel Aviv University.  
It was carried out by **Or Shalev** and **Ayelet Hashahar Barel**, under the academic guidance of **Prof. Meir Ariel**.

The goal of the project is to develop a full-featured **software simulator** for **Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)** based on the **McEliece cryptosystem** â€” a method known for its resilience against quantum attacks. 

The simulator allows for:
- Encoding and decoding of messages using error-correcting codes
- Simulation of random and controlled error injection
- Analysis of computational complexity and decoding success rates
- An intuitive GUI for simulation setup and results visualization

This work contributes to the ongoing global effort to build cryptographic systems that remain secure in the age of quantum computing.
